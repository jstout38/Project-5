JUSTIN STOUT PROJECT 5
NEIGHBORHOOD MAP

Hello! To run this app clone the repository to your local machine and run the index.html file.

The app will display 20 restaurants in Kinston, NC, which is the hometown of the app's creator. A list on the left will display the locations, and a Google Map with markers will display the locations geographically. The locations can be searched by name, address, and keywords by using the search box at the top of the list view. This app is fully responsive and can be used on all mobile devices; the list view switches to a drop down to facilitate using the app on mobile devices.

Please enjoy using this app!
